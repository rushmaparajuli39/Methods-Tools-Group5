## Description: Python menu driven program for an e-commerce store that stores data in MYSQL databases

* This project is the group project for Methods and Tools class where we used mysql database and a python for the frontend. We decided to go with python because it can create a connection to  the databases easily. 

## Features:

* An e-commerce store that can be run from the command line. 

* Once the system is up and running, users will be able to log in or make an account. 

* Users can not continue unless they log in,  and that they have the option to terminate if they don't want to log in. 

* Once logged in, user must be able to interact with all things, shop, and manage their account.

* Projects must be able to store data while the program isn't running.
